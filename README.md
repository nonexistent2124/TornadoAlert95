So this was a fun project I made using Java. I was inspired randomly by severe thunderstorms sweeping across the area of Ann Arbor, Michigan (where I live) on June 18, 2025. I have quite a bit of experience with terminals, DOS, Linux, etc. So, I made a weather app using Java (and Java Swing for the UI). I love command prompts and the insane amount of customization Linux offers and stuff like that. Most weather apps use a graphical user interface (GUI), but I wanted to make one with a command prompt for fun (and to hone my Java skills). With a little help from Microsoft Copilot, this is my final version. It's called TornadoAlert95 (the 95 for 1995, like Windows 95. Plus it has a 90s kind of vibe.) I hid a few Easter eggs in it too. I made the logo and all the assets for the GUI version with Piskel.

Pictures of the software can be found in the etc/ folder.

To run:
Compile with a Java compiler (i.e using JDK) or use an IDE (like IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, Apache NetBeans, etc) to run the TornadoAlert95 Java code.
Type "help" for a list of commands to run (I hid a few Easter eggs in there.)


Versions:
TornadoAlert95 v3.6 classic - command-line interface
TornadoAlertGUI95 - uses a GUI instead

     
Welcome to TornadoAlert95!

Notes:
- Developed using IntelliJ IDEA.
- Took about a day to complete.
- Uses OpenWeatherMap's API service for real-time weather data.
- I used Linux as my developing OS.
- Made with ðŸ§¡
