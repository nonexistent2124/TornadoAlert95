So this was a fun project I made using Java. I was inspired randomly by severe thunderstorms sweeping across the area of Ann Arbor, Michigan (where I live) on June 18, 2025. I have quite a bit of experience with terminals, DOS, Linux, etc. So, I made a weather app using Java (and Java Swing for the UI). I love command prompts and the insane amount of customization Linux offers and stuff like that. Most weather apps use a graphical user interface (GUI), but I wanted to make one with a command prompt for fun (and to hone my Java skills). With a little help from Microsoft Copilot, this is my final version. It's called TornadoAlert95 (the 95 for 1995, like Windows 95. Plus it has a 90s kind of vibe.) I made the logo and all the assets for the GUI version with Piskel.

Pictures of the software can be found in the etc/ folder.

To run:

Notes for TornadoAlert95 & TornadoAlertGUI95:
Make sure that if you are finding the weather for a location in the U.S, put the state and country!
Example:
Detroit, US ‚ùå
Detroit, MI ‚ùå
Detroit, MI, US ‚úî


Versions:
TornadoAlert95 - command-line interface
TornadoAlertGUI95 - uses a GUI instead
